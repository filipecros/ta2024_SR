The input files of "Terra-Nova, F., Amit, H. Regionally-triggered geomagnetic reversals. Sci Rep 14, 9639 (2024)"

Files names are given by the choice of control parameters except for Pr, which is unity for all dynamos simulations. 
As so Pm8E14Ra47q10 has Pm=8, E=1E-4, Ra=4E7 and q*=1.0.

The spatial resolution:
All models have spatial truncation lmax=170 and radial grid Nr=81. The radial description is done by chebshecv polinomns
 
The temportal resolution:
courfac=3.0,
alffac=1.5,
dtmax=1.e-5,
alpha=0.6,
